# 👋 Hi, I’m Houssem

I’m a **self-taught software engineer** and long-time **aviation operations specialist** based in Tunisia.  
For 16 years I worked as a ramp dispatcher and load master in a high-pressure, real-time environment — and during the last year I’ve been building software to automate that work.

I don’t have a CS degree; instead, I’ve spent my life in front of a computer, learning by doing and using **AI-assisted development** to move fast and ship real tools.

## 🚀 What I’m working on

I use a combination of **ChatGPT (for reasoning and design)** and **AI code assistants in VS Code** (for implementation) to build production-style apps.  
I always verify generated code with tests, debugging and first-principles thinking.

### Airport Operations Tools (in negotiation with my company)

- **Turn-Around App**  
  Web app to track every aircraft service (GPU/APU, water, toilet, cleaning, fueling) in real time.  
  → Improves transparency, reduces radio noise, and helps understand delays.

- **Coordination Desktop App**  
  Python/Tkinter + Firebase tool that lets the control room push updated flight lists, SLOTs and instructions to all teams instantly.  
  → Replaces Excel + WhatsApp; everyone sees the same live data.

- **Weekly Dispatcher Roster Engine**  
  Python scheduling engine that reads flight data and generates a full weekly roster respecting shift rules, night-shift limits and fairness constraints.  
  → Saves hours of manual planning and reduces errors.

- **Task Distribution App**  
  Web/mobile interface (backed by Firebase) that assigns ramp staff (loaders, cleaners, drivers, etc.) to flights based on the roster and turn-around schedule.  
  → Optimises manpower and avoids double-assignments or gaps.

### Side Project – Restaurant Ordering System

- **Restaurant Ordering Demo**  
  Customer + restaurant apps with a fast-food style menu, extras, dynamic pricing and real-time order status (using Firebase).  
  → Built as a demo to practice multi-client architectures and UX.  
  → UI in French.

## 🧠 How I work with AI

- Use **AI** to:
  - break down problems from first principles  
  - explore design options & trade-offs  
  - reason about edge cases and data flow

- Use **AI code assistants in VS Code** to:
  - generate boilerplate and refactors  
  - speed up implementation of small functions and UI

- Always:
  - review and edit generated code  
  - add targeted tests or manual checks  
  - instrument the code to understand performance and behaviour

I see AI as a **power tool** for engineers, not a replacement for thinking.

## ⚽️ Interests

- **Sports** fan (traditional sports + sports media)  
- **Esports**, especially Counter-Strike – I follow the pro scene, tournaments, stats and discussions closely.  
- Music (guitar), creative projects, and using tech to modernise daily work.
